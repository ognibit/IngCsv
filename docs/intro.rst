Ing Explore
===========
Ing Explore is a python module, with command line, to analyze the transactions of a Ing Direct account.
The module works on the account transactions exports, for the `italian Ing website <https://www.ing.it/>`_.
The input file should be XLSX or CSV.

Prepare the data
----------------
From the personal account page (Conto Corrente Arancio), click on the excel export icon to get the transactions.

**ATTENTION**: there's a weird behavior when you try to export more than 4 months.

XLSX
####
The easiest way to prepare the data is to open the downloaded XLS file and save it as XLSX.

CSV
####
You can provide a CSV file (comma as delimiter), selecting only the table with transactions on the excel sheet and export it as CSV (you can paste the selection into a new sheet and export it).
